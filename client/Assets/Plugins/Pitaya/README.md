# How to Use

## Connecting
```cs
client = new PitayaClient();
client.NetWorkStateChangedEvent += networkState => {
    switch(networkState) {
        case PitayaNetWorkState.Connected:
            break;
        case PitayaNetWorkState.Disconnected:
            break;
        case PitayaNetWorkState.FailToConnect:
            break;
        case PitayaNetWorkState.Kicked:
            break;
        case PitayaNetWorkState.Closed:
            break;
        case PitayaNetWorkState.Connecting:
            break;
        case PitayaNetWorkState.Timeout:
            break;
        case PitayaNetWorkState.Error:
            break;
        default:
            throw new ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(networkState), networkState, null);
    }
};
client.Connect("127.0.0.1", 3241);
```

Always call `Dispose()` when you are done with the client. This is very important because unity doesn't handle unmanaged code memony very well. So calling this method will clear the memory and avoid Unity becoming unresponsive
Ex:
```cs
private void OnApplicationQuit()
{
    if(_client != null)
    {
        _client.Dispose();
        _client = null;
    }
}
```

## Making a request
```cs
client.Request("connector.getsessiondata",
    res => {
        Debug.log($"[connector.getsessiondata] - response={res}");
    },
    error => {
        Debug.log($"[connector.getsessiondata] ERROR - error-code={error.Code} metadata={error.Metadata}");
});
```

## Listening to a server push
```cs
_client.OnRoute("some.push.route", body => {
    Debug.log("[some.push.route] PUSH RESPONSE = " + body);
});
```

## Using Protobuf
The library supports protobuf when you provide the protobuf class as the type parameter. In the following example, `PushData` and `RequestResponse` are classes generated by protobuf.
```cs
_client.OnRoute<PushData>("some.push.route", (PushData data) => {
    Debug.log("[some.push.route] PUSH RESPONSE = " + data);
});

client.Request<RequestReponse>("connector.getsessiondata",
    (RequestReponse res) => {
        Debug.log($"[connector.getsessiondata] - response={res}");
    },
    error => {
        Debug.log($"[connector.getsessiondata] ERROR - error-code={error.Code} metadata={error.Metadata}");
});
```

## Using TLS
Copy the ca root certificate to `Assets/StreamingAssets` and initialize the client like this:
```cs
client = new PitayaClient("ca.crt");
```

## Using public key pinning
Pitaya also supports public key pinning. This allows the client to reject servers whose public key does not match one of the keys specified by the application. Libpitaya can receive multiple keys, and adding them is one function call:

```cs
// Pass the name of the certificate file. Libpitaya will extract 
// the public key from the certificate. Note that the certificates *must* be
// located inside the StreamingAssets folder.
PitayaBinding.AddPinnedPublicKeyFromCertificateFile("server.crt");

// You can also directly pass the certificate string instead of the path to the file.
var contents = File.ReadAllText(Path.Combine(Application.streamingAssetsPath, "server.crt"));
PitayaBinding.AddPinnedPublicKeyFromCertificateString(contents);

// If you do not want to use public key pinning, you can call this function (the default is to not use key pinning):
PitayaBinding.SkipKeyPinCheck(true);

// You can clear the certificate keys as well. Note that doing this and using 
// SkipeKeyPinCheck = false will reject *all* servers.
PitayaBinding.ClearPinnedPublicKeys();
```

**IMPORTANT**: 
* The certificate passed to libpitaya _must_ be the same one used by the server. The certificate cannot be the root certificate, for example, it will not work.

* The keys added in libpitaya are global while the library is running. This means that all pitaya clients (`new PitayaClient(...)`) will watch for all of the keys added. Also, since Unity *does not* unload the library unless the editor is restarted, clearing the keys just before the app exits is a good idea.
